// File generated with Firebase CLI.
// This is a placeholder file. 
// The real file will be generated when Firebase is set up with flutterfire configure

// for different platforms.

// For now, we're using a mock implementation of Firebase Auth
// Later, this file will be replaced with the actual configuration
